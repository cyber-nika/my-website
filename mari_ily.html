    <h1>Forever in my heart</h1>
    <h2>To Mari</h2>
    <p>My Heart’s Delight

        On the 30th of November, a day so divine,
        A spark was ignited, and our hearts did align.
        A moment so simple, yet it changed everything,
        For in that soft instant, my heart found its wing.
        
        Mari, my love, with eyes full of grace,
        You filled my world with the brightest embrace.
        Every word you speak, every laugh that you share,
        Creates a melody I can’t help but declare.
        
        The day we first met, the universe seemed to pause,
        As if the stars themselves gave their silent applause.
        In the softest of whispers, I found my true home,
        With you by my side, I never feel alone.
        
        Your kindness, your spirit, your beautiful soul,
        Together with you, I feel completely whole.
        Each moment with you feels like a dream come true,
        Mari, my love, I am so thankful for you.
        
        Through the days and the nights, our love has grown strong,
        With every heartbeat, it sings our sweet song.
        30th November, our love took its start,
        A date now forever etched deep in my heart.
        
        With you, every second is cherished and bright,
        In your presence, my world is full of light.
        So here’s to us, and the love we share,
        A love that’s eternal, beyond all compare.</p>
